Start with DSCE \u00b6 Go to https://dsce.ibm.com/ to use the DSCE Wizard, Click Get Started , Select \"Find and try AI\", click Start, Click Build with AI libraries , Click Build with Watson NLP , Click Entities extraction , Click Library and container , Demo: Use a Pre-Trained Model \u00b6 Click Use a pre-trained model , Click Next, Review he Try steps: Try steps: Step 1: Discover potential use cases; Step 2: Try the interactive demo application; Step 3: Get an application code sample; Step 4: Start experimenting in our sandbox; and Step 5: Learn more. Some use cases under Step 1 for entity extraction can be Voice of the Customer , Extract Personal Identifiable Information (PII) for Compliance or Verification , Let's run a demo by running the application code sample in Step 3, Get the code for the Entity Extraction demo app at https://github.com/IBM/dsce-sample-apps/tree/main/entity-extraction , Run the code for the client demo following the instructions in the Github README, Open the UI at http://0.0.0.0:8050 , The demo uses a client that accesses the Watson NLP Runtime, which is packaged as a container image hosted on the IBM Entitled Registry. You will need an entitlement key to access it. The demo uses the Watson NLP Runtime deployed on IBM Code Engine, see the client code: # pre-defined URL for backend SERVER_URL = 'https://8f96122371.dsceapp.buildlab.cloud' # API end-points used REQ_URL = SERVER_URL + '/v1/watson.runtime.nlp.v1/NlpService/EntityMentionsPredict' Deploy your own Solution \u00b6 To deploy your own instance of IBM Watson Natural Language Processing Library for Embed, you need an Entitlement Key. You can use a free trial license for up to 180 days. Click the Deploy tab, To get your entitlement key, click the Get trial license and access container button, Signup or login using your IBM Id, You need to sign up for the IBM Watson Natural Language Processing Library for Embed Trial You can apply to qualify for $3000 credits on IBM Cloud.
