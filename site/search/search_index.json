Objective \u00b6 In this demo, I will show how to include advanced AI functionality from IBM Watson in your own applications and use the Watson NLP library for Entities Extraction as an example. In the example I use a pre-trained model but I will also show how to customize a model to increase accuracy for your specific domain using IBM Watson Studio and re-build a custom image of the Watson NLP. I use an online wizard (DSCE) to guide anyone through the steps. Terms Used \u00b6 Some terms used: DSCE is IBM Digital Self-Serve Co-Create Experience (DSCE) , an IBM wizard that makes it easy to try IBM products like IBM Watson libraries. IBM TechZone makes free POC environments or sandboxes of IBM products available to IBM partners. To access TechZone your IBM Id must be registered in your PartnerPlus account. You must have an IBM PartnerPlus account. IBM Build Lab is part of the IBM Ecosystem Engineering organization that helps IBM partners with embedding IBM products in their own product (as part of an ESA agreement) for free. Embedded AI refers to the use of AI directly in your own products or IBM products so that you can run your AI applications anywhere, including disconnected on-prem environments, Azure, or AWS. Other IBM products use embedded AI : Instana, Turbonomic, Watson Assistant, Watson Discovery, Maximo, Maximo Visual Inspection (MVI), etc. Agenda \u00b6 Start with DSCE wizard, Demo: Use a Pre-Trained Model, Start with DSCE \u00b6 Go to https://dsce.ibm.com/ to use the DSCE Wizard, Click Get Started , Select \"Find and try AI\", click Start, Click Build with AI libraries , Click Build with Watson NLP , Click Entities extraction , Click Library and container , So now you are familiar with DSCE, let's look at using a pre-trained model in a demo. Demo: Use a Pre-Trained Model \u00b6 In this section, I will continue in DSCE and run sample Python code embedding Watson NLP with the pre-trained model in a demo. Click Use a pre-trained model , Click Next, Review he Try steps: In Step 1, you can review a few use cases: entity extraction can be Voice of the Customer , a technique used to gather and analyze feedback from customers to improve products, services, and the customer experience. Or, extract Personal Identifiable Information (PII) for Compliance or Verification, Skip the live demo application in Step 2, because I am running the demo from the application code sample in Step 3, In step 3, get the code for the Entity Extraction demo app at https://github.com/IBM/dsce-sample-apps/tree/main/entity-extraction , Run the code for the client demo following the instructions in the Github README, Open the UI at http://0.0.0.0:8050 , The demo uses a client that accesses the Watson NLP Runtime, which is packaged as a container image hosted on the IBM Entitled Registry. You will need an entitlement key to access it. The demo uses the Watson NLP Runtime deployed on IBM Code Engine, see the client code: # pre-defined URL for backend SERVER_URL = 'https://8f96122371.dsceapp.buildlab.cloud' # API end-points used REQ_URL = SERVER_URL + '/v1/watson.runtime.nlp.v1/NlpService/EntityMentionsPredict' Now you have seen how you can deploy the Watson NLP Runtime and embed it in your client code. Next, let's look at the required steps to get started using embedded AI in your own solutions. Embed AI in your own Solution \u00b6 To deploy your own instance of IBM Watson Natural Language Processing Library for Embed, you need an Entitlement Key. Click the Deploy tab, Get Entitlement Key \u00b6 To deploy Watson NLP Embed AI libraries you need to have an IBM account and an entitlement key to use as a license, If you don't have an IBM Cloud account, Create an IBM Cloud account , To get your entitlement key, log into your MyIBM Dashboard Click the Get trial license and access container button, Signup or login using your IBM Id, In the Container Software & Entitlement Keys tile, click View Library , You can view existing or create new entitlement keys, Signup for Trial of Watson Studio \u00b6 You need to sign up for the IBM Watson Natural Language Processing Library for Embed Trial You can apply to qualify for $3000 credits on IBM Cloud. Go to https://dsce.ibm.com/wizard/try/results/embed-nlp-entities-container-pt#deploy . In your MyIBM Dashboard , you can see your Trials In the IBM Watson Natural Language Processing Library for Embed tile, click Manage, Go back to MyIBM Dashboard and scroll down to the Cloud Paks & container software section, Access TechZone \u00b6 To customize a model you can use an instance of Watson Studio on TechZone. IBM TechZone makes free POC environments or sandboxes of IBM products available to IBM partners. Go to https://techzone.ibm.com/dashboard , To reserve a Watson Studio environment, follow the instructions in this TechZone Tutorial , Use a Custom Model \u00b6 Check your Reservations in TechZone , to make sure the Watson Studio sandbox is Ready, If the Environment Status is Ready, continue, Login to https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/home2?context=cpdaas In the top right, you should see an active account 2577353 - tsglwatson , if not, switch the active account, In the Projects tile, you should notice a project named emotion-classification-[hash] , Click the emotion classification project to open it, You should see 3 assets: Emotion Classification - Custom Model , Emotion Classification - Pre-Trained Model , and emotion-tweets.csv , If you don't see all 3 assets, click the View all link in the assets tile or go to the Assets tab, Next, create an asset token, Click on the Manage tab. Switch to the Access control menu item on the left, then select Access tokens, If no token exists yet, click New access token, Enter a Name for the access token, and select Editor in the Access role. Then, click Create. Click on the Assets tab, and find the notebook Emotion Classification - Custom Models. Click the three dots on the right to open a drop-down menu, select Edit, Once your notebook loads, in the top right of the horizontal tool bar, click the 3 dots dropdown, and select Insert project token, You are now ready to customize your model, Build Custom Model Image \u00b6 Instead of using the pre-trained model, you can also use the customized model and build the custom model image for deployment. Follow the instructions below. Go back to the Deploy tab at https://dsce.ibm.com/wizard/try/results/embed-nlp-entities-container-pt#deploy , In Step 2, click Package and deploy your application, In the Infuse your product with AI from IBM page, select Watson NLP, Select Build a model image, Select Custom model, Click Next, Review the Try steps, To build the custom model container, review the tutorial , Work with IBM Build Lab \u00b6 Learn More \u00b6 To learn more about embeddable AI using Watson NLP see the Assets for Watson NLP by Build Lab at https://github.com/ibm-build-lab/Watson-NLP .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#embeddable-ai","text":"","title":"Embeddable AI"},{"location":"#pre-requisites","text":"Open landing page DSCE , Open https://github.com/IBM/dsce-sample-apps/tree/main/entity-extraction , Open Watson NLP for Embed Script , Open http://localhost:8050/ for local demo, Open DSCE site, Open Contact Us in DSCE, Open IBM Watson Natural Language Processing Library for Embed Trial , Open Watson NLP Hands-on Tutorial , Open TechZone asset Watson NLP Library Hands-on Lab , Create Watson Studio sandbox in TechZone, Open to edit Jupyter Notebook Emotion Classification - Custom Model , Open MyIBM Dashboard ,","title":"Pre-requisites"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#about-me","text":"...","title":"About Me"},{"location":"#objective","text":"In this demo, I will show how to include advanced AI functionality from IBM Watson in your own applications and use the Watson NLP library for Entities Extraction as an example.
